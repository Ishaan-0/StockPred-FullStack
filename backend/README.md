This is a python project that uses library FastAPI to create a REST API for use with the frontend.

## Getting Started

First, clone the github repo: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishaan-0/StockPred-FullStack.git && cd StockPred-FullStack
```

Next, move to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Next, install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Lastly, run the Apis.py file:
