This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the github repo: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishaan-0/StockPred-FullStack.git && cd StockPred-FullStack
```

Next, move to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**Note: frontend would not work if the backend server (Apis.py) is not running**
