# Stock Prediction Algorithm and Web App

This repository contains a stock prediction algorithm developed using machine learning techniques. It predicts the future price movements of stocks based on historical data.

The repository also showcases a web app that uses Next.js and REST APIs to get data from the machine learning algorithm and predict stock values and display them in a graphical format.

## Description

- Uses historical stock data for training
- Applies machine learning algorithms for prediction
- Provides accuracy metrics for evaluation

## Usage

To use the algorithm and web app:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the steps listed in frontend/README.md and backend/README.md
3. Run the prediction script with appropriate parameters.
